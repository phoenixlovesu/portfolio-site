                <p>Dear Hiring Manager,</p>
                <p>I am currently pursing a <strong>Bachelor of Science in Computer Science</strong>  at Western Governors University and am seeking opportunities where I can apply my growing skills. With a long term goal of becoming a <em>software engineer</em>, I am seeking to gain hands-on experience contributing to meaningful technical projects.</p>
                <p>Through personal projects like <em>Focus Flow</em>, a productivity web app, I have developed skills in debugging, problem-solving, and structuring functional user interfaces using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I have also participated in hackathon projects like <em>Hearth</em> and <em>Lovelace Logs</em>, where I helped with front-end development, UI design, and research. These experiences improved my capacity to adapt, collaborate, and <mark>document technical processes</mark>.</p>
                <p>I am especially drawn to roles that value <strong>creativity</strong>, <strong>teamwork</strong>, and <strong>user-focused design</strong>. I would appreciate the opportunity to bring my energy and dedication to your team while continuing to grow as a developer. Thank you for considering my application.</p>
                <p>Sincerely,</p>
                <p><span class="name">Phoenix Kargbo</span></p>
